I have access to the:

Nvidia Tesla V100
- CUDA Cores 5120 Cores
- Max threads per block 1024
- 80 Steraming Multiprocessors
- Maximum threads per multiprocessor 2048
- Warp size 32 threads


A block is a group of threads that execute a kernel (function running on GPU).
Streaming multiprocessor manages and executes multiple CUDA cores.
Each SM can mange up to 2048 active threads at a given time

Warps are threads that execute instructions together in lockstep. There are 32 in each. The GPU schedules warps, not threads.
